### flags are:
    # -c path to config.csv, c for config
    # -r path to folder with fastq reads, r for reads
    # -a path to folder with fasta reference sequences, a for alignment
    # -u if present, we only have one fastq file per sample, rather than one with Fw reads and one with Rv reads
    # -l whether to filter the bam file or not; l for fiLter; filtering is ON if flag is given, OFF if not

# in addition, flags from filterBAM.command:
    # -i = input = bam file to process
    # -e = PhrEd score = minimum Phred score
    # -f = floor = minimum read span
    # -s = maximum proportion soft-clipped
    # -d = padding around double-strand break site
    # -p = keep only primary alignments? yes or no
    # -o = output = name of bam file to output
