# v1
# no more argument cutpos & cutdist, should read from the mut table

# v2
# simulateIns will add newlyseq & newlyseq_bp columns already
# if we see that it is filled (not with NA), we should skip that part

# expects mutation table written by callMutations

# example -----------------------------------------------------------------

# mut <- read.csv('~/Dropbox/miseqUtils/mutcallsTest.csv')


# detectTemplatedIns ------------------------------------------------------

# overarching function which loops through rows of mut
# it is mainly a wrapper for detectTemplatedIns_one

# in detectMHdel, we could just test every row because detection is fast
# but detection of templated insertions is slow
# approach here is to only look at *unique* alignments where there is at least one insertion
# then copy the results of the detection in mut wherever the alignment is the same

# complete test dataset 151k rows: 8 min
# it is 1074 unique alignments with insertion

# will leave for now; but for the record: a further improvement would be to trim the alignment around cut position
# then keep only unique trimmed
# currently, we would repeat the detection if e.g. there is 1-bp substitution 150 bp from the cut position
# which is a waste of time as it does not change the outcome of the detection

# for 1k rows taken as random from test dataset: improvement is ~ 36 sec to ~ 6-7 sec

  # general logic is: if it continues being mismatches (could be insertion or substitution), it is probably part of the newly synthesised sequence
  # but we could get "lucky matches", which are positions where the newly synthesised sequence matches the original sequence,
  # even though the newly synthesised sequence was untemplated or copied from a region elsewhere

    # more generally, whenever number of mismatches is 0 in the few nucleotides ahead, we are done
    # i.e. we found the start of the newly synthesised sequence
    # look between position just before leftmost modified nucleotide
    # and 'allowStretchMatches' after (to the left)
    # are there any modified nucleotides in that window?

  # we now have first (left-most) mismatch and last (right-most) mismatch
  # guaranteed not to have other mismatches nearby (a bit before left-most or a bit after right-most)
  # precisely: there are no mismatches in the 'allowStretchMatches' nt before left-most
  # and there are no mismatches in the 'allowStretchMatches' nt after right-most

  # if "lucky matches" were random (should be approx. correct I think?),
  # probability of one should be 1/4, followed by another one is 1/4 * 1/4, etc
  # so probability that we are correct to extend by 2 nt is 6%
  # probability that we are correct to extend by 3 nt is 1.5%
  # (correct meaning the extra nucleotides we take were indeed newly synthesised during repair)
  # I think 3 nt extra on either side is reasonable
  # but will leave it flexible with extendNewlySeq

# not as simple as just adding number of ---,
# need to look at insertions starting before position and add their lengths

# pos_ori = position on original reference sequence
# refsp = aligned reference sequence, split

# note, to do the opposite (i.e. position on aligned reference to position on original reference)

  # correct those positions so that they refer to the original reference
  # will make it a bit simpler later so all positions use the same reference
  # and we do not have to worry about correcting positions of later insertions to account for previous ones
  # we have function fixpos() in allelesToMutations.R for this

  # ...tgtaggtcgtcat---------gGGG
  # last t is #89
  # hypos would be 90, 91, ..., 98
  # correction by fixpos will give 89, 89, ..., 89

  # so wherever greater than 0 there is a jump in the positions, i.e. a new insertion starts
  # we should keep separate the hyphen positions of each insertion
  # we have small function splitAt from allelesToMutations.R which is exactly for that purpose

  # positions with hyphens, after fixpos, are 89, 89, 89, 92, 92, 92, 101, 101, 101
